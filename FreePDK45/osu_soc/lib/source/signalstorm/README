Setting up the Daemon:

1) ipsd (on as many stations as you want)
2) ipsc -w 4
3) ipsc -w4 -n hspice
4) ipsstat
5) ipsmon -s servername

Running Signalstorm
1) Setup daemon as shown above
2) run_ss
3) Go to files directory and copy all generated files ("cp ../gscl45nm.* .)
4) finish_slc

Notes
The run_ss script runs SignalStorm with "ss_script" which:
 - import netlists into signalstorm
 - run dbgsim to create test vectors
 - run db_setup to prepare Spice run
 - the main step that runs spice (takes a while)
 - Outputs the final .alf file

The finish_slc script creates all the output files.
