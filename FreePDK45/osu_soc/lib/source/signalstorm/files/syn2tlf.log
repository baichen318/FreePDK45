About the messages:
1) Every message has a unique identifier, referred to as "message_id".
2) Every message falls into one of the following categories, referred to as
   "category_id":
     "LI" : messages falling into this category highlight the inconsistencies
            of the source library. e.g. syntax errors and library deficiencies
     "DI" : messages falling into this category highlight the issues that might
            cause problems when the generated TLF library is used by the tools
            in a flow. e.g. zero input-pin-capacitance
     "OI" : all other messages fall into this category. e.g. command line
            errors and system messages.
3) The message_id and category_id are printed on the extreme right on the first
   line of every message below. They appear as:
       [<category_id>-<message_id>]
4) To get extended help on any message below, invoke the following from the
   command line:
       syn2tlf -h <message_id>...
